## Hi, we are Lantern

![Image banner with the text: Transform how your people get specialty care. Lantern connects members with specialty care that gets them back toliving life—back to good health, back to their families and back to work.](banner.png)

For over 13 years, Lantern has helped our members and their families find excellent care when they need it most. We started with surgery, focusing on better care, local access and great results at lower costs.

Since then, we’ve grown to include cancer care and infusion therapy. From supporting cancer patients through every step of their journey to making infusion treatments more affordable and accessible, we’re here to make specialty care simpler and better.

We are always looking for passionate people to help us transform access to excellent care.
